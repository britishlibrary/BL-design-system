# ESLint Config React

This package provides the British Library ESLint and Prettier configuration.

## ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.

## Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It removes original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
